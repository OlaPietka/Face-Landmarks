# Face Landmarks
This is a continuation of [previous project](https://github.com/OlaPietka/SnapchatFilters_Py--In-process--).
In this project I am using Dlib library to recognize facial landmarks.

The 68 facial landmarks are numbered in the following form. With the points of the mouth can be detected when the mouth is open and then display filters like a rainbow coming out (to be done).
